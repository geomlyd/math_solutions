\chapter{Open Sets and Closed Sets}

\begin{exercise}{1}
    Show that an ``open rectangle'' $(a, b) \times (c, d)$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
    More generally, if $A, B$ are open in $\mathbb{R}$, show that $A \times B$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
    If $A, B$ are closed in $\mathbb{R}$, show that $A \times B$ is closed in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    Call the open rectangle $S$, in which case its defining property is $S = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : a < x < b, c < y < d\}$.
    Let $p = (x, y) \in S$, and set $r = \min\{x - a, b - x, c - y, d - y\}$.
    Now let $p' = (x', y')$ be any point in $B_r(p)$.
    This means that $\lvert \lvert p' - p \rvert \rvert_2 < r$.
    More specifically, this translates to the following inequalities:

    $$\lvert x' - x \rvert < x - a \implies x' - x > a - x \implies a < x'$$
    $$\lvert x' - x \rvert < b - x \implies x' - x < b - x \implies x' < b$$    
    $$\lvert y' - y \rvert < y - c \implies y' - y > c - y \implies y' > c$$
    $$\lvert y' - y \rvert < d - y \implies y' - y > d - y \implies y' < d$$

    These four properties mean that $p' \in S$, and thus we have proved that $S$ is indeed open.

    For the sake of generality, for the remaining exercise we will work with $A, B$ being subsets of two general metric spaces $(M, d), (N, \rho)$, respectively, and then the general result will imply what is asked for here.
    First of all, we select $d_{\infty}$ as the metric of $M \times N$, with the definition given in exercise 46 of Chapter 3.
    Suppose first that $A, B$ are open, and pick $(a, b) \in A \times B$.
    There exist then open balls $B_{\epsilon_1}^{d}(a) \subset A, B_{\epsilon_2}^{\rho}(b) \subset B$.
    Pick $\epsilon = \min\{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2\}$, and consider any $(x, y) \in B_{\epsilon}^{d_{\infty}}((a, b))$.
    We have that:
    
    $$d_{\infty}((x, y), (a, b)) < \epsilon \implies \max\{d(x, a), \rho(y, b)\} < \min\{\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2\}$$

    Notice that this implies that, more specifically, $d(x, a) < \epsilon_1, \rho(y, b) < \epsilon_2$, which means $x \in B_{\epsilon_1}^{d}(a) \subset A, y \in B_{\epsilon_2}^{\rho}(b) \subset B$.
    In other words, $x \in A, b \in B$, and so $(x, y) \in A \times B$, which shows that $B_{\epsilon}^{d_{\infty}}(a, b) \subset A \times B$, and thus the Cartesian product is also open.

    Now suppose that $A, B$ are closed, which implies $M \setminus A, N \setminus B$ are open.
    Consider rewriting $A \times B$ as follows:

    $$A \times B = \{(x, y) \in M \times N \lvert x \in A, y \in B\} = (M \times N) \setminus \{(x, y) \in M \times N \lvert x \notin A \text{ or } y \notin B\}$$
    $$ = (M \times N) \setminus ((A^{c} \times N) \cup (M \times B^{c}))$$

    Now, from the immediately preceding proof, $A^{c} \times N, M \times B^{c}$ are open as Cartesian products of open sets (a metric space is always open).
    Their union is thus also open, and then the complement of this union, which we showed equals $A \times B$, is thus closed.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{3}
    Some authors say that two metrics $d, \rho$ on a set $M$ are equivalent if they generate the same open sets.
    Prove this.
    (Recall that we defined equivalence to mean that $d, \rho$ generate the same convergent sequences.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    First suppose that two metrics $d, \rho$ generate the same open sets.
    Pick any sequence $(x_n) \in M$ such that $d(x_n, x) \rightarrow 0$, and pick $\epsilon > 0$.
    The ball $B_{\epsilon}^{\rho}(x)$ is open under $\rho$, and must thus also be open (although not necessarily a ball) under $d$.
    By convergence of $x_n \rightarrow x$ under $d$, we have that $(x_n)$ is eventually in $B_{\epsilon}^{\rho}(x)$, which of course means that we have showed that $\rho(x_n, x) \rightarrow 0$ as well.
    Exchanging the roles of $d, \rho$ completes the proof that they are equivalent under the sequence-based definition.

    Conversely, assume that $d, \rho$ generate the same convergent sequences.
    Suppose $S$ is an open set under $d$.
    If $S$ is the empty set, it is also clearly open under $\rho$.
    Otherwise, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $S$ is not open under $\rho$, which means that there exists $x \in S$ such that for every $\epsilon > 0$, $B_{\epsilon}^{\rho}(x) \not\subset S$.
    More specifically, this means that for a sequence of $\epsilon_n = \frac{1}{n}$, we can always find $x_n \notin S$ such that $x_n \in B_{\epsilon_n}^{\rho}(x)$.
    But then it becomes clear that $\rho(x_n, x) \rightarrow 0$, which means that $d(x_n, x) \rightarrow 0$ as well.
    Therefore we have constructed a sequence that has an infinite number of terms that do not belong in $S$, and at the same time converges to $x \in S$ under $d$.
    Because $S$ is open under $d$, this is a contradiction, and we therefore conclude that $S$ must also be open under $\rho$.
    Exchanging the roles of the two metrics completes the proof in this direction, thus showing that the two definitions are equivalent.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{5}
    Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous.
    Show that $\{x: f(x) > 0\}$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$, and that $\{x: f(x) = 0\}$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    Let $S = \{x: f(x) > 0\}$.
    Pick any $x \in S$, in which case $f(x) > 0$.
    Let $\epsilon = f(x)$, and then because $f$ is continous, there must exist $\delta > 0$ such that:

    $$\lvert y - x \rvert < \delta \implies \lvert f(y) - f(x) \rvert < \epsilon$$

    The second inequality implies $-\epsilon < f(y) - f(x) \implies f(y) > f(x) - f(x) = 0$.
    Notice then that for every $y \in B_{\delta}(x)$ we have $f(y) > 0$, and thus that $y \in S$, which shows that $S$ is open.

    Now let $T = \{x: f(x) = 0\}$.
    Notice that $T = \mathbb{R} \setminus (\{x: f(x) > 0\} \cup \{x: f(x) < 0\})$.
    It is very easy to show that the above also holds for ``less than zero'', thus rendering the union here a union of open sets, and then $T$ a closed set as a complement of an open set.

\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{7}
    Show that every open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of countably many open intervals with $\textit{rational}$ endpoints.
    Use this to show that the collection $\mathcal{U}$ of all open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$ itself.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    We know already that an open set $S \subset \mathbb{R}$ can be written as $S = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty}(a_n, b_n)$, where the intervals are all disjoint, and perhaps unbounded.
    Consider the following procedure.
    We take the interval $(a_n, b_n)$, where in general the endpoints are real numbers.
    We know that between them there will always be a rational number $q_n$.
    In fact, $b_n$ can be approached by a (increasing) sequence of rational numbers starting at $q_n$ and getting infinitely close to it, and the same holds for $a_n$ (only difference being the fact that this will be a decreasing sequence).
    These are \textit{countably infinite} in number: indeed, each sequence is equivalent to the natural numbers, since these directly form its indices, and of course $\mathbb{N} \cup \mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}$ (``two sequences are equivalent to one sequence'').

    We can thus replace $(a_n, b_n)$ with a union of the form $\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} (q_k, r_k)$ where the endpoints are rationals.
    But then we have that $S$ is a countable union of countable sets, which we know (Theorem 2.6)  is also countable, and thus $S$ is indeed a countable union of intervals with rational endpoints.
