\begin{exercise}{1}
    If $A \subset B \subset M$ and \(B\) is totally bounded, then \(A\) is totally bounded.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    Pick any $\epsilon > 0$.
    By Lemma 7.1, because $B$ is totally bounded, there exist finitely many sets $B_1, \ldots, B_n \subset B$ such that $\text{diam}(B_i) < \epsilon$ for all $i$ and $B \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_i$.
    Let then $A_i = B_i \cap A$, each of which is clearly a subset of $A$.
    It holds of course that $\text{diam}(A_i) \leq \text{diam}(B_i) < \epsilon$.
    Furthermore, because $A \subset B \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_i$, any $x \in A$ must belong in at least one $B_i$, and hence also in the corresponding $A_i$, which means that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i$.
    By all of the above and Lemma 7.1, we conclude that $A$ is totally bounded.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{2}
    Show that a subset $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is totally bounded if and only if it is bounded.
    In particular, if $I$ is a closed, bounded, interval in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\epsilon > 0$, show that $I$ can be covered by finitely many closed subintervals $J_1, \ldots, J_n$, each of length at most $\epsilon$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}

    We recall example 7.2 (a): a totally bounded set $A$ is necessarily bounded.
    To show this, pick $\epsilon = 1$ and obtain $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_1(x_i)$.
    Set $M = \max_{i, j} d(x_i, x_j)$ and pick any two $x, y \in A$, for which it must hold that $x \in B_i, y \in B_j$ for some $i, j$.
    By the triangle inequality:

    \[d(x, y) \leq d(x, x_i) + d(x_i, x_j) + d(x_j, y) < 1 + M + 1 = M + 2\]

    This of course shows that $A$ is bounded.
    
    Conversely, if $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is bounded, then $\text{diam} A < R$, which in $\mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to $A \subset [-R, R]$.
    For any $\epsilon > 0$, set $N = \lceil \frac{2R}{\epsilon} \rceil$ and subdivide $[-R, R]$ into $N$ closed subintervals of length $\epsilon, [-R, a_1], [a_1, a_2], \ldots [a_{N-1}, R]$.
    Then observe that any element of $A$ must belong in one of these intervals, and thus is at most $\epsilon$-far from some $a_i$.
    Since there are finitely many $a_i$, we conclude that $A$ is totally bounded.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{4}
    Show that $A$ is totally bounded if and only if $A$ can be covered by finitely many \textit{closed} sets of diameter at most $\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon > 0$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    $\implies$: Suppose first that $A$ is totally bounded and pick any $\epsilon > 0$.
    Then there exist finitely many $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_{\epsilon/4}(x_i)$.
    As in the book, we may assume that $A \cap B_{\epsilon/4}(x_i) \neq \emptyset$ for all $i$, and thus for each $x_i$ find $a_i \in A, a_i \in B_{\epsilon/4}(x_i)$.
    Now, pick any $y \in B_{\epsilon/4}(x_i)$, and by the triangle inequality:

    \[d(y, a_i) \leq d(y, x_i) + d(x_i, a_i) \leq \epsilon/4 + \epsilon/4 \leq \epsilon/2\]

    This shows that all elements of $B_{\epsilon/4}(x_i)$ belong in the \textit{closed} ball of radius $\epsilon/2$ around $a_i$.
    More specifically then, all elements of $A$ that were covered by $B_{\epsilon/4}(x_i)$ are also covered by this closed ball.
    We conclude that the union of these $n$ closed balls ---each of which of course has diameter $\epsilon$--- covers $A$.

    $\impliedby$: Conversely, suppose that for any $\epsilon > 0$, $A$ can be covered by finitely many closed sets of diameter at most $\epsilon$.
    For any $\epsilon > 0$, use this hypothesis on $\epsilon/2$ to obtain finitely many closed sets $S_1, \ldots, S_n$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} S_i$ and $\text{diam}(S_i) \leq \epsilon/2$ for all $i$.
    Once again, we may safely assume that $A \cap S_i \neq \emptyset$ for all $i$, and thus for every $i$ find an $a_i \in A, a_i \in S_i$.
    For any $y \in S_i$, it holds that $d(y, a_i) \leq \text{diam}(S_i) \leq \epsilon/2 < \epsilon$, and so $y \in B_{\epsilon}(a_i)$.
    This means that all elements of $A$ that were covered by $S_i$ are also covered by $B_{\epsilon}(a_i)$, meaning that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_{\epsilon}(a_i)$, which is of course the definition of total boundedness for $A$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{5}
    Prove that $A$ is totally bounded if and only if $\overline{A}$ is totally bounded.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
   $\implies$: Suppose $A$ is totally bounded and pick any $\epsilon > 0$.
   Find $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_{\epsilon/2} (x_i)$, which is always possible due to $A$ being totally bounded.
   For any $z \in \overline{A}$, we have the following.
   If $z \in A$, we have that $z$ is inside at least one of these $n$ balls of radius $\epsilon/2$, and thus also inside the corresponding ball of radius $\epsilon$.
   If $z \notin A$, by the definition of the closure it must be that $y_i \rightarrow z$ for some $(y_i) \subset A$.
   Then there exists $N > 0$ such that for all $i > N, d(y_i, z) < \epsilon/2$.
   Pick any of these $y_i$, and find a corresponding $x_j$ such that $y_i \in B_{\epsilon/2}(x_j)$.
   By the triangle inequality, $d(y_i, x_j) \leq d(y_i, z) + d(z, x_j) < \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon$, which means that $y_i \in B_{\epsilon}(x_j)$.
   We've therefore shown total boundedness for $\overline{A}$.

   $\impliedby$: In the other direction, recall that $A \subset \overline{A}$, so by Exercise 1 if $\overline{A}$ is totally bounded, $A$ is as well.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{9}
    Give an example of a closed bounded subset of $l_{\infty}$ that is not totally bounded.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    Consider the set corresponding to the sequence examined in Example 7.2 (d):
    \[S = \{(1, 0, \ldots), (0, 1, 0, \ldots), (0, 0, 1, \ldots), \ldots\} \subset l_{\infty}\]

    It's easy to see that the set is bounded, since all of its elements have a $l_\infty$ norm of 1.
    At the same time, it is closed, since the only convergent sequences it contains are eventually constant ones.
    However, the observation given in that example shows that it is not totally bounded: any two of its elements are at a distance of 1, and hence no finite number of balls of radius less than 1 can cover it.

\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{10}
    Prove that a totally bounded metric space $M$ is separable. [Hint: For each $n$, let $D_n$ be a finite $(1/n)$-net for $M$.
    Show that $D = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} D_n$ is a countable dense set.]
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    
    Suppose $M$ is totally bounded, and form the construction indicated in the hint.
    Namely, for each $n$, collect the \textit{finite}, due to total boundedness, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{k_n}$ needed to cover $M$ with balls of radius $1/n$.
    Call this set of $k_n$ elements $D_n$, and let $D = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} D_n$, which is countable as a countable union of countable sets.
    Now, select any $y \in M$ and for each $i$, select an element $x_i \in D_i$ such that $d(y, x_i) < 1/i$, which is guaranteed to exist.
    Notice that this sequence gets arbitrarily close to $y$, and hence $D$ is also dense, showing that $M$ is separable.
\end{solution}
