# math_solutions
My solutions to subsets of math problems from various textbooks.
The problems were mostly selected by a mathematician friend who organizes an "assisted self-study" group, and the solutions have also been proofread by him (occasional errata may of course be present).

The repo is organized in subdirectories, one per book.
