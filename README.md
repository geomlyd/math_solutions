# Problem Solutions from Various Mathematical Textbooks

This repository contains my solutions to selected problems from various mathematics textbooks. 
Problems were curated and reviewed by a mathematician friend in the context of an assisted self-study group.  

The repo is organized in subdirectories, one per book.
Each of them contains a `main.pdf` file of the typed solutions in LaTeX.
Minor errata may be present.
