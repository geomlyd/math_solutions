# Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right

This text served as my first encounter with proof-based Linear Algebra.
The book is far from beginner friendly and definitely not recommended as
a first text for Linear Algebra if one does not already have some
familiarity with matrices, linear equations etc.
It's also not an easy book: many of the problems are quite challenging 
and, perhaps most importantly, there is no indication of which these 
are.
Hints are also scarce.

Nevertheless, the theory presentation is excellent and the proofs quite 
elegant.
Don't expect a lot of familiarity with determinants after finishing the
book though, since the whole premise of the book is that determinants
get introduced too early in the study of Linear Algebra, thus needlessly
complicating proofs.
However, since they are useful in further study of the subject, and
since they appear often in other domains (multivariate calculus, 
probability theory etc.), one should be aware of this and seek some
supplementary material.

The exercises presented here start at Chapter 5, since unfortunately
before that point I was not actively typing up problems in $\LaTeX$.
