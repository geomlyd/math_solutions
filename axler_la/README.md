# Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right

This text served as my first encounter with proof-based Linear Algebra.
The book is far from beginner friendly and definitely not recommended as a first text for Linear Algebra if one does not already have some familiarity with a) matrices, linear equations etc. and b) mathematical proofs themselves.
It's also not an easy book: many of the problems are quite challenging and, perhaps most importantly, there is no indication of which these are.
Hints are also scarce.

Nevertheless, the theory presentation is excellent and the proofs quite elegant.
Don't expect a lot of familiarity with determinants after finishing the book though, since the whole premise of the book is that determinants get introduced too early in the study of Linear Algebra, thus needlessly complicating proofs.
However, since they are useful in further study of the subject, and since they appear often in other domains (multivariate calculus, probability theory etc.), one should be aware of this and seek some supplementary material.

The exercises presented here start at Chapter 5, since unfortunately before that point I was not actively typing up problems in $\LaTeX$.
