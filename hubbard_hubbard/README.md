# Hubbard & Hubbard's Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach

The problems presented here are often rather sparse due to the book containing mostly computational exercises.
As such, Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds and Duistermaat's Multidimensional Real Analysis serve as an "exercise companion" to the theory presented in this book.
